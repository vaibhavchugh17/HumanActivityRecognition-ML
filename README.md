# Human Activity Recognition - A Multi-Class Classification ML Project


In this project, Iâ€™m implementing 4 multi-class classification models on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR) data set with a trivial majority-guess
model as a baseline. The data set is obtained from Kaggle and its information is obtained from the UCI repository.  

### For a detailed explanation, please refer to the project report (Report.pdf)  

## The project contains the following files:  

dataset - Directory containing the data set. Please refer to the README inside this directory to gain some additional insights on the data  
figures - Directory that contains all the plots and figures that were generated by the code.  

Report.pdf  - A brief report explaining the project and the results.  
code.ipynb  - Code in ipynb format.  
code.html   - Code structured as a Jupyter notebook but in HTML format.  

For references, please refer to the bottom of the report and code files for their respective references.  
To run the code, please make sure you are inside the project directory and simply run the ipynb file.
